# pickarator
a python based application that allows you to import class lists and pick them for answering questions in class.
The students who were not picked are saved in a leftover file so you can more fairly pick students over several class
periods.

The application also has an option to rate the students respose after picking.
The student is rated on a scale.
that student rating  is saved to the class rating file wth a time and date stamp.

A Utf test file is the sorce for the class name.  As this was developed in China Chinese characters and pinyin are used.

I run this application on an android python interpreter. so it can more easily be used in class
